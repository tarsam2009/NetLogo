# Normally "git submodule update --init", run by the sbt extensions task, clones
# our submodules from read-only URLs.  But if you are a NetLogo committer,
# you want to clone from URLs that you have push access to.  Running this
# script after cloning the main repo will override the URLs in .git/config
# so you can push to all repos.

git config submodule.models.url git@github.com:/NetLogo/models.git

# The above seems not to be doing the trick unless you run it before cloning,
# which is hard to remember to do.  So we bring out the big hammer:

( cd models; git remote set-url origin git@github.com:/NetLogo/models.git )
